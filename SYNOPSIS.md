## 1. Title of the Project

**Task Manager CLI Application**

---

## 2. Introduction

The Task Manager CLI is a command-line based application developed using Java and Maven. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of core Java concepts, file handling using JSON, and version control using Git. The application allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently through a simple text-based interface.

This project is developed as part of the academic curriculum to showcase understanding of software development practices including object-oriented programming, build automation with Maven, and collaborative development using Git version control system.

---

## 3. Objectives of the Project

- To develop a functional command-line task management application using Java
- To implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for task management
- To demonstrate file handling by storing tasks in JSON format using Gson library
- To practice version control using Git with proper branching strategies
- To learn Maven build tool for dependency management and project packaging
- To create a runnable JAR file for easy distribution and execution

---

## 4. Problem Statement / Need of the Project

In today's fast-paced environment, managing daily tasks efficiently is crucial for productivity. While many GUI-based task managers exist, there is a need for a lightweight, fast, and resource-efficient solution that can run on any system with Java installed.

Many students and developers prefer command-line tools for their simplicity and speed. This project addresses the need for:
- A simple task tracking system without complex setup
- Persistent storage of tasks across sessions
- Quick access to task management without launching heavy applications
- Learning practical implementation of Java, Maven, and Git concepts

---

## 5. Scope of the Project

The scope of this project includes:

**Included Features:**
- Add new tasks with title
- List all tasks with completion status
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Persistent storage using JSON file
- Interactive CLI menu

**Future Enhancements (Out of Current Scope):**
- Task priorities and categories
- Due dates and reminders
- Search and filter functionality
- Multi-user support
- GUI version

---

## 6. Methodology / Tools Used

### Development Methodology
- Incremental development approach
- Feature-based branching strategy
- Code review through Pull Requests

### Tools and Technologies

| Tool/Technology | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Java 11** | Core programming language |
| **Maven** | Build automation and dependency management |
| **Gson 2.10.1** | JSON serialization/deserialization |
| **JUnit 5** | Unit testing framework |
| **Git** | Version control system |
| **GitHub** | Remote repository hosting |
| **VS Code / Kiro IDE** | Code editor |

### Git Workflow Used
- Main branch for stable releases
- Dev branch for development
- Feature branches (feat/add-task, feat/json-support, feat/cli-menu)
- Hotfix branches for quick fixes
- Pull Requests for code merging

---

## 7. Expected Outcomes

Upon completion of this project, the following outcomes are expected:

1. **Functional Application:** A working CLI-based task manager that can add, list, complete, and delete tasks

2. **Persistent Storage:** Tasks saved in JSON format that persist across application restarts

3. **Executable JAR:** A packaged JAR file that can be run on any system with Java installed

4. **Clean Git History:** Well-documented version control history demonstrating:
   - Proper commit messages
   - Branch management
   - Merge and rebase operations
   - Conflict resolution
   - Pull Request workflow

5. **Unit Tests:** Test cases validating core functionality
